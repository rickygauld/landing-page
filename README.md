# landing-page
Practice creating an entire web page using HTML and CSS.

The majority of CSS stylization utilize Flexbox and flex properties to position content. Flexbox allows the website to be built using responsive web design. No matter the size of the screen, the webpage will remain organized and adjust to different dimmensions accordingly.

The project repository is publicly displayed on GitHub. I will periodically revisit the project to include additional content with new CSS tricks I want to experiment with.
